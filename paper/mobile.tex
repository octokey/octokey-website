Browser and phone meet at rendezvous point (URL in QR code) / communicate over rendezvous channel

We must assume that the contents of the barcode can be read by an attacker: it may be

screen. In order to establish a secure channel between the smartphone and the desktop browser, it is
therefore not appropriate to embed a symmetric private key in the barcode.
